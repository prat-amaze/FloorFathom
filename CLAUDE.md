# FloorFathom

Cozmo AI case study (`Applied AI.pdf`): from handheld iPhone captures (photos, video,
LiDAR) produce a dimensioned, stitched whole-property floor plan plus damage regions
and scope items, one command per capture, JSON to the published schema. Scoring:
walk-in test 30%, fix loop 25%, benchmark accuracy 15%, compliance matrix 10%,
head-to-head vs a consumer app 10%, capture route 5%, process evidence 5%.

## Docs

- `capture_protocol.md`: the required one-page capture protocol, followed literally
  at the defense. Keep it in sync with how the data was actually captured.
- `edge_cases.md`: edge cases in the capture data the pipeline must handle.
- Both files state what we have, not every step taken.

## Data

- `Data/`: iPhone 16 captures (no LiDAR device). Photos are HEIC in `images/<room>/`,
  videos are `.MOV` at the top level. The LiDAR tier uses Cozmo-provided sample data.
- Ground truth is measured using tape. Staged damage and real damage are labeled separately.
