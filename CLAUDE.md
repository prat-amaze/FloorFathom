# FloorFathom

Cozmo AI case study (`Applied AI.pdf`): from handheld iPhone captures (photos, video,
LiDAR) produce a dimensioned, stitched whole-property floor plan plus damage regions
and scope items, one command per capture, JSON to the published schema. Scoring:
walk-in test 30%, fix loop 25%, benchmark accuracy 15%, compliance matrix 10%,
head-to-head vs a consumer app 10%, capture route 5%, process evidence 5%.

## Docs

- `capture_protocol.md`: the required one-page capture protocol, followed literally
  at the defense. Keep it in sync with how the data was actually captured.
- `edge_cases.md`: edge cases in the capture data the pipeline must handle.
- Both files state what we have, not every step taken.

## Data

- `Data/`: iPhone 16 captures (no LiDAR device). Photos are HEIC in `images/<room>/`,
  videos are `.MOV` at the top level. The LiDAR tier uses Cozmo-provided sample data.
- Ground truth is measured using tape. Staged damage and real damage are labeled separately.


## Code

- `uv sync`, then `uv run floorfathom plan <capture_folder> --out out/<name>`; tests with `uv run pytest`
  (about 6 minutes, synthetic captures in `tests/synth.py`).
- LiDAR tier per-room plans work; the video tier runs end to end per clip but misses its wall and opening
  gates, and the photo tier's state is in `README.md`'s status table. See `README.md` for
  the module map, verification numbers and known limitations.
- `schema/capture_plan.schema.json` is generated: after changing `schema.py`, run
  `uv run floorfathom schema > schema/capture_plan.schema.json` (a test checks they match).
- `CozmoData/` and `Data/` are two different flats. `ground_truth.json` belongs to `Data/` only.
